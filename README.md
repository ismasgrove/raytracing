# Raytracer

This is an exercise on raytracing using the resource 'Raytracing in a Weekend' book series from Peter Shirley, who somewhat of a legend in the field. I decided to do it in Rust so as to not feel as if I'm just copying code or implementing things without understanding them, which happens when you're doing something from a book or a tutorial. I added the parallel element (using rayon) for the same reason, and will generally try to add as many personal touches as I can.
